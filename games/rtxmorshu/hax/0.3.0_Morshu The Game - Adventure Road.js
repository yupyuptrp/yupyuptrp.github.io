This update is what it says. its the EVERYTHING update. The biggest update you have seen so far. Sus town expansion? Backrooms update V2? True lab update? Combat update part 3? Levelling update? The mine update? I could go on forever. Everything that has been planned was stuffed into this one update. (Which means that there are also a lot of potential glitches and bugs: please report one if you find it)","\n","^.. On a separate note, thanks to everyone who suggested different interesting things which made it into this update (and maybe even into the \"RTX Morshu Easter Eggs: Season 2\"'s release! Go check that out on my youtube channel: koshkamatew)","\n","^. Many smaller changes have been made to almost every location/aspect in the game! Only the big and obvious things are mentioned in the changelog, with more secret or small changes being hidden, awaiting discovery...","\n","^. Added 16 new endings","\n","^. Added 26 new achivements","\n","^. Added 4 new quests","\n","^. Added gamemodes:","\n","^.. Normal: Play the game without any modifications!","\n","^.. Godmode: Play the game with infinite resources and overpowered items. (Will be available 2 weeks after the update's initial release)","\n","^.. Added a QUICK START button to the launcher to skip everything and send you to the road in normal mode.","\n","^. Added credits","\n","^.. to showcase myself and retards like shadowlobandi and yupyuptrp. and also some cool people like simisage who drew a bunch of concept art for the game along with ideas or &raller with his cheap morshu game wiki","\n","^. Added a LEVEL SYSTEM!","\n","^.. Collect XP by defeating enemies and completing quests","\n","^.. Level up at the level altar (New location on the road) to gain more hp, more damage, rubies, new crafting recipes, new locations and more!","\n","^.. The max level at the moment is level 5.","\n","^. Added a bunch of new locations (Some of them are listed below in the changelog)","\n","^. UPDATED THE BACKROOMS","\n","^.. Time for some more levels.","\n","^... Added levels: Level 5, Level 6, Level 37.5, Level 434, The End, Level ! and Mallparking (Non-fanon/canon level, i made this one on my own because level 1 was already taken into the game by past me and i needed this one in)","\n","^.... Reworked the \"Backrooms escape artist\" ending, because the end is now a location that you can explore.","\n","^. Added Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place","\n","^. Added a new location: The Field","\n","^.. Get there from the road","\n","^.. Literally just a field so you can touch grass, someone suggested that in my discord server so i did it. If you want to also suggest something then join my discord using the link in the game's description!","\n","^. Added a new location: The Mine","\n","^.. Get there from the mountain","\n","^.. You can mine Stone/Iron and sell it at the miner's shop.","\n","^.. Miner will also sell you pickaxes to mine stone and iron. Yeah, just stone and iron, no diamonds (for now)","\n","^. Added a new location: The True Lab","\n","^.. It's about time.","\n","^. Expanded Sus Town","\n","^.. the original 0.2.8 update!","\n","^. Added a new location: Library","\n","^.. Its in the town","\n","^. Added a new location: Cinema","\n","^.. Its in the town","\n","^. Added countless more undisclosed locations.","\n","^. Updated the car shop: you now can return to the shop even after buying the car.","\n","^. Added The Armory","\n","^.. Store your weapons and armor (and axes and pickaxes and everything you can) in slots to use later!","\n","^.. Located on the road","\n","^.. With the adition of new weapons, axes, pickaxes, armor and more, some with their own special effects, it is inevitable that one would want to use several weapons, armor etc. which he can swap between at any time. Armory does just that for you! You have 2 slots for each category (weapon, armor, axe, pickaxe) into which you can store your items, allowing you to have up to 3 different items of each category! (This number might increase in the future, but for now it is not necessary)","\n","^. Updated the HUD's internal system. Using the new internal improvements to the hud, i was able to add it to a lot more locations without any limitations.","\n","^.. Updated the sack: it now has its items sorted by category.","\n","^.. Added new inventory categories: Inventory, Accessories and Special Items","\n","^. Buying tools now also requires some materials","\n","^.. Rusty axe: 5 wood","\n","^.. Thick axe: 10 thick wood","\n","^.. Old pickaxe: 10 wood","\n","^.. Stone pickaxe: 15 stone","\n","^. Added more Morshu talk interactions, river man interactions etc.","\n","^. Added more gun KILL interactions","\n","^. Repairing armor and healing now costs 2 rubies instead of 10.","\n","^. Armor now reduces damage taken instead of adding Max HP","\n","^. Added a new accessory: Mother Wolf Talisman (Adds 15 MHP)","\n","^. Added a new accessory: Chaos Talisman (Increases Damage Dealt by 5%)","\n","^. The battery's cost was increased from 100 > 250 rubies","\n","^. Updated the jobs list. And the job location as a whole!","\n","^. Updated the death screen (In places where it's shown)","\n","^. CRAFTING TABLE: ADDED NEW CRAFTABLE ITEMS","\n","^.. Stone Sword","\n","^.. Iron Sword","\n","^.. Chaotic Bat / Level 1","\n","^.. Chaotic Bat / Level 2","\n","^. Armorsmith (bazaar) now sells new items:","\n","^.. Iron Chestplate","\n","^. Added a NEW WOOD TYPE: Red Wood","\n","^.. You need a power 3 axe to chop it (Which you now can obtain!)","\n","^.. Dangerous to chop. Each chop there is a 12.5% chance to encounter an enemy! (66% wolf, 33% red moth)","\n","^.. Sells at 4 rubies per wood piece","\n","^.. Go deeper into the second big tree area to find","\n","^. Added a new enemy: Red Moth","\n","^.. Fairly strong, id suggest you get some armor and at least a stone sword for the fight...","\n","^.. Drops 1 red wing on death.","\n","^. Added a new enemy: Chaotic Formation","\n","^.. Encountered when mining iron with a 6.25% chance","\n","^.. Very Strong but very fragile. You will need a strong weapon, but armor's usefulness is questionable against its stong attacks","\n","^.. Drops 2-4 chaos essence on death","\n","^... This can be increased by using the chaotic bat (Up to 8 essence)","\n","^.. Drops 1 chaos crystal on death, if you kill it with a chaotic bat of level 2 or higher","\n","^. Buffed the Mother Wolf","\n","^.. Damage: 10 > 11.5","\n","^.. Health: 125 > 165","\n","^.. Also changed the drops: the mother wolf now also drops a special item - The Mother Wolf's Heart.","\n","^. Nerfed the wolf encounter rate when chopping thick wood.","\n","^.. 20% > 6.25%","\n","^.. The previous 1 in 5 chops encounter rate was there to make thick wood a less attractive option to chop for money over normal wood, but with the addition of a new wood type, i think its fair to make thick wood more attractive in terms of farming for money.","\n","^.. To make up for the new 1 in 16 chops rate, I nerfed the cost of thick wood.","\n","^.. 4 per piece > 3 per piece","\n","^.. I have also made the rusty axe more expensive","\n","^.. 20 rubies > 25 rubies","\n","^.. This rework of thick wood should make it easier to farm at the cost of it being cheaper, with the 6.25% encounter rate being considerably more rare than the area being infested with wolves.","\n","^. Nerfed the wood's sell rate from 2 rubies per piece to 1 ruby per piece","\n","^.. This is due to all the new additions.","\n","^. Colored some more text. Heck yes, colored text!","\n","^. Added a new way to get the clash royale reference achievement. By that i mean i added another clash royale reference. Yeah, sorry, with a lumberjack in the game him attacking you with an axe eventually was inevitable. No guns allowed in their stores!","\n","^. Updated the Edited ending. While previously matching with the secret ending (a long time ago when it still was final ending) it has now been outdated for a while and updated to match the NEW secret ending. Because of that, the new secret ending has been updated as well to make it possible to get the new edited ending. Also, fixed the edited ending. Yup, it was sorta broken and the basement door would just dissapear at times...","\n","^. Updated QUESTS. Most quests must first be UNLOCKED before you are able to see them on the quest board. This should give the player less hints on what there is to do with quests","\n","^.. Updated the GrubHub to be tracked more accurately (so the board and your progress actually match)","\n","^.. Morshu's smelly roof quest will remain always unlocked as a tutorial quest.","\n","^.. There is now some more info on the quest borad.","\n","^. Updated the past versions changelog - Version's name is now included and updated some older version changelogs","\n","^. Updated the tutorial to be more accurate and better","\n","^.. It now also gives you an ending!","\n","^. Removed all code related to dungeons from the game","\n","^.. Hey, i mean, maybe one day...","\n","^. Fixed the glitch where you could sell negative amounts of wood and thick wood.","\n","^.. You would get a negative ruby balance and get wood...","\n","^... Basically BUYING wood, but you can get credit. Yeah. Apparently this glitch was never discovered by anyone and i was the first person to try and sell negative wood for some reason during testing... Or whoever found it just didnt report it.","\n","^. Fixed the glitch where crafting an item with only enough of one material made it dissapear","\n","^.. Example: you try to craft something for 1 thick wood and 2 normal wood, but you dont have normal wood. Normal wood ends up dissapearing from your inventory forever.","\n","^. Fixed the entirety of the \"Outside Monke HQ\" location.","\n","^.. You can't pick up the gun modification over and over again now.","\n","^.. Same goes for the scenario where you already have the glowkey.","\n","^.. Added a \"Leave\" option (\"option\")","\n","^.. The first actual fix to this location after like over a year lmao","\n","^. Fixed a LARGE AMOUNT OF SPELLING MISTAKES","\n","^.. Talking about spelling mistakes, i've changed every \"aswell\" to \"as well\".","\n","^. Fixed the town water hydrant being kickable twice","\n","^. Fixed the morshburger being eatable without you having one in the backrooms","\n","^..........","\n","ev","str","^Return to Menu","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^See past versions changelog","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"#":"CLEAR"},{"->":"menu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",["ev","str","^Version 0.2.9 - The (Altered) Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.8 - The Unknown Update, 0.2.8.1, 0.2.8.2 and 0.2.8.3 - Hotfixes","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.7.1 / Version 0.2.7.winter - It's Gifting Time!","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.7 - The Reworked RPG Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-3","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.6 - The Combat Master Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-4","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.5 - Mini Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-5","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.4 - The Bazaar Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-6","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.3 - The Looks Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-7","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.2 - The Genocide Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-8","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.1 - The Advanced GrubHub Raid Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-9","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.2.0 - The Cringe & Fly update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-10","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.9 - The Bunker Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-11","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.8 - The Quality Of Life Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-12","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.7 - The Drip Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-13","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.6 - Mini Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-14","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.5 - The Backrooms And Menu Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-15","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.4 - The Secrets Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-16","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.3 - Mini Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-17","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.2 - The Sus Town Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-18","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.1 - The Mountain Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-19","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.0 Hotfix - Mini Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-20","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.1.0 - The Cursed World Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-21","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.9 - The MorshBurger Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-22","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.8 - Mini Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-23","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.7 - The Void Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-24","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.6 - The Most Fun, Fun, Fun Update Out Of All!","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-25","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.5 - The Beach Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-26","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.4 - The HUD Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-27","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.3 - The Haunted Forest Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-28","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.2 - The Detailed Update","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-29","flg":4},"ev","str","^Version 0.0.1 - Game Release","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-30","flg":4},"ev","str","^Return","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-31","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n","^Version 0.2.9 (27th April, 2022) - The (Altered) Update ",{"#":"CLASS: LightSeaGreen"},"\n","^..........","\n","^.

Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?","\n","^Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, \"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.\"","\n","^Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.","\n","^So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh... Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?","\n","^Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death.
